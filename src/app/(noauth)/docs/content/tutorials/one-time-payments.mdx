This tutorial walks you through setting up one-time payments using Stripe Checkout. I’ve done the heavy lifting so you can quickly integrate payments into your project without reinventing the wheel.

<br />

## Environment Setup

<div id="environment-setup" />

1. **Stripe Account:**
Create an account on [Stripe](https://stripe.com/). Once logged in, navigate to [API Keys](https://dashboard.stripe.com/apikeys) to retrieve your keys.

2. **Configure Environment Variables:**
In your **.env.local** file, add:

```bash
STRIPE_SECRET_KEY=sk_live_...
STRIPE_PUBLIC_KEY=pk_live_...
```

<br />

## Creating a Checkout Session

<div id="creating-a-checkout-session" />

We use an API endpoint to create Checkout Sessions. This function is defined in our libs/stripe/checkout.js. For one-time payments, set the mode to "payment".

```jsx
// Example usage:
const session = await createCheckoutSession({
    planType: "starter",  // or "pro"
    mode: "payment",
    successUrl: "https://your-app.com/thank-you",
    cancelUrl: "https://your-app.com/",
});
```

The returned session ID is then used on the client to redirect your customer to Stripe’s secure payment page.

<br />

## Testing Your Payment

<div id="testing-your-payment" />

- **Test Card:**
Use the test card number [4242 4242 4242 4242](https://stripe.com/docs/testing) for a successful payment.

- **Verify:**
Ensure that your webhook endpoint logs the payment events correctly.

<br />

## Additional Tips

<div id="additional-tips" />

<Tip>
    Customize the Checkout Session by adding metadata or adjusting tax settings directly in the session options.
</Tip>

<Caution>
    Always secure your API keys and webhook secret in your environment variables.
</Caution>

<Warning>
    In production, double-check your [Stripe Dashboard](https://dashboard.stripe.com/) settings, such as authorized domains and redirect URLs.
</Warning>
