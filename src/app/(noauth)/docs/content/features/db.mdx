This boilerplate includes a set of modular, reusable utility functions to perform common database operations with Supabase. Whether you need to fetch data, insert new records, update or delete existing ones, or even call custom Postgres functions (RPC), these utilities make it easy.

## Fetching Data

<div id="fetching-data" />

Use the **fetchData** function to run SELECT queries on your tables. For example, to get all rows from a table named "characters":

```jsx
const { data, error } = await fetchData("characters", "*", { name: "Harry" });
``` 

<Info>
    You can pass filters as an object to narrow down your results. Experiment with different filters to optimize your queries.
</Info>

## Inserting Data

<div id="inserting-data" />

Insert new records using the **insertData** function. It supports both single and multiple record insertions.

```jsx
await insertData("countries", { id: 1, name: "Mordor" });
``` 

<InlineHighlight>
    Tip: Ensure your object keys match your table columns.

## Updating & Upserting Data

<div id="updating-upserting-data" />

**Updating Data:**  
Use **updateData** with filters to change existing records.

```jsx
await updateData("instruments", { name: "piano" }, { id: 1 });
``` 

**Upserting Data:**  
The **upsertData** function inserts a record if it doesn’t exist or updates it if it does.

```jsx
await upsertData("instruments", { id: 1, name: "piano" });
``` 

## Deleting Data

<div id="deleting-data" />

Delete records safely with **deleteData**. Always include filters to avoid removing unintended rows.

```jsx
await deleteData("countries", { id: 1 });
``` 

<Warning>
    Always include appropriate filters when performing DELETE operations.
</Warning>

## Calling Functions (RPC)

<div id="calling-functions" />

Call custom Postgres functions using **callFunction**. For example, if you have a simple "hello_world" function:

```jsx
const { data, error } = await callFunction("hello_world");
console.log(data); // "Hello world"
``` 

## Filters & Best Practices

<div id="filters-best-practices" />

Filters let you narrow down your queries. For example, to fetch only rows where "name" equals "Leia":

```jsx
const { data, error } = await fetchData("characters", "*", { name: "Leia" });
``` 

<InlineHighlight>
    Tip: Chain filters as needed, but test your queries to ensure they’re efficient.

These utilities are designed to simplify your database interactions so you can focus on building great features without re-inventing common CRUD operations.
