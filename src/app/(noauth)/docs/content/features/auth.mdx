<div id="overview" />

Here, you get a secure and ready-to-use auth system that handles email/password and social logins.
<div className="flex my-2" />
This auth system is built on Supabase and Next.js 14, leveraging the new App Router features. It provides a seamless user experience with automatic cache revalidation and redirections.
<div className="flex my-4" />
<Info>
    All sensitive operations run exclusively on the server so your credentials and secret logic stay hidden.

## How It Works

<div id="how-it-works" />

<div className="flex my-6" />

**1️⃣ Input Validation**

When a user submits their credentials, the system first validates the input using a schema (powered by Zod). This ensures emails, passwords, and confirmations are correctly formatted.

```jsx
// Minimal snippet for validating signup data:
const result = SignupFormSchema.safeParse({ email, password, confirmPassword });
if (!result.success) {
// Return or display validation errors
}
```

<div className="flex my-10" />

**2️⃣ Server-Side Authentication**
The validated data is passed to a server action that securely calls Supabase methods. For example, signing up or logging in happens on the server so that nothing sensitive ever reaches the client.

```jsx
// Example snippet: signing up a user
const { error } = await supabase.auth.signUp({ email, password });
if (error) {
// Handle error appropriately
}
```

<div className="flex my-10" />

**3️⃣ Cache Revalidation & Redirection**
After a successful auth operation, the cache is revalidated and the user is redirected to their account page. This happens automatically to keep the UI in sync.

```jsx
// Trigger cache update and redirect:
revalidatePath('/', 'layout');
redirect('/account');
```

## Benefits

<div id="benefits" />

- **Simplicity:**
No need to rebuild the wheel—everything is set up out of the box.
- **Security:**
Server-only operations keep your secret credentials safe.
- **Performance:**
Automatic cache revalidation and redirections provide a smooth user experience.

<Tip>
    With this setup, you can focus on building your app instead of re-creating auth flows.

## Production Tips

<div id="production-tips" />

<Caution>
    Ensure your Supabase URL and anon key are stored securely in your .env.local file.
</Caution>

<Warning>
    When deploying, double-check your middleware and session configurations so that protected routes are truly secure.
</Warning>

That’s it—auth is heavy lifting I’ve already done for you. Now you can build amazing apps without reinventing the authentication logic every time.
