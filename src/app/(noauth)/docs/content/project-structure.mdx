Runway.js follows a typical Next.js project structure with some custom organization. Here's an overview of the main directories and files:
<br />

### Top-level Structure

At the root of the project, you'll find these key elements:

| Folder/File | Description |
|-------------|-------------|
| `src/` | Contains all the application source code |
| `public/` | Stores static assets to be served directly |
| `.env.local` | Holds local environment variables |
| `package.json` | Lists project dependencies and scripts |

The `src` folder contains all of our application code, while `public` is for static assets. The `.env.local` file stores all
our local environment variables (API keys, etc.).

<br />

<Warning>
    Never commit your `.env.local` file to version control. It contains sensitive information like API keys and should be kept private.
</Warning>

<br />

### `src` Folder Structure

Inside the `src` folder, we organize our code into several directories:

| Path | Description |
|------|-------------|
| `app` | Contains the Next.js 13+ App Router structure |
| `components` | Houses React components organized by atomic design |
| `contexts` | Stores React context providers for global state management |
| `libs` | Contains shared libraries and utilities (e.g., Stripe, Mailgun) |
| `utils` | Holds utility functions used across the application |

This structure allows for a modular approach to development, separating concerns and making it easier to find and maintain different parts of the application.

<br />

<Info>
    The `src` folder is optional in Next.js, but it's a good practice for keeping your project root clean and organized.
</Info>

### `app` Directory Structure

The `app` directory is the heart of our Next.js application, structured as follows:

| Path | Description |
|------|-------------|
| `(auth)` | Contains routes that require user authentication |
| `(noauth)` | Houses public routes accessible without authentication |
| `actions` | Stores server actions for handling form submissions and data mutations |
| `api` | Contains API routes for backend functionality |
| `auth` | Holds authentication-related files and logic |
| `lib` | Stores library files specific to the app directory |

This structure leverages Next.js 13's app router, allowing for easy organization of authenticated and public routes.

<Tip>
    Use route groups (folders starting with parentheses) to organize your routes without affecting the URL structure.
</Tip>

<br />

#### `(noauth)` Directory

The `(noauth)` directory contains our public-facing pages:

| Path | Description |
| ---- | ----------- |
| `docs` | Documentation pages for users and developers |
| `login` | The user login page |
| `policies` | Legal pages such as privacy policy and terms of service |
| `sign-up` | The user registration page |

<br />

#### `(auth)` Directory

The `(auth)` directory contains our authenticated pages, add as many as needed.

<br />

<Info>
    Runway automatically redirects users to the login page if they try to access an authenticated route without being logged in.
</Info>

<br />

### `components` Directory

We use the atomic design methodology to organize our React components:

| Path | Description |
|------|-------------|
| `atoms` | Basic building blocks like buttons, inputs, and labels |
| `molecules` | Slightly more complex components composed of atoms |
| `organisms` | Large, complex components often composed of molecules and atoms |

This structure promotes reusability and maintainability of our UI components.

<br />

<Tip>
    When creating new components, consider their reusability. If a component is used in multiple places, it might belong in the `atoms` or `molecules` directory.
</Tip>

### Configuration Files

Key configuration files in our project:

| Path | Description |
|------|-------------|
| `src/config.js` | Central configuration file for application-wide settings |
| `src/middleware.js` | Next.js middleware for route protection and redirects |

These files are crucial for managing application behavior and security.

<br />
<br />

### `app` Routing Conventions

We follow Next.js routing conventions in our `app` directory:

| File | Description |
|------|-------------|
| `layout.js` `.jsx` `.tsx` | Defines the layout for a route segment |
| `page.js` `.jsx` `.tsx` | Represents a UI that is unique to a route |
| `loading.js` `.jsx` `.tsx` | Creates loading UI for a segment |
| `not-found.js` `.jsx` `.tsx` | Creates not found UI for a segment |
| `error.js` `.jsx` `.tsx` | Defines error UI for a segment |
| `route.js` `.ts` | Creates API endpoints |

These conventions allow for intuitive and powerful routing capabilities within our Next.js application.

<Tip>
    Use `loading.js` to create seamless loading experiences for your users. It's automatically used by Next.js for route segments.
</Tip>

<Warning>
    Be cautious when using `route.js` in the same directory as `page.js`. They can conflict and lead to unexpected behavior.
</Warning>

This structure allows for a clear separation of concerns, making it easier to navigate and maintain the project as it grows. For more detailed information on specific parts of the project, refer to the related documentation pages.
