One-Time Payments allow you to charge a single fee for access to your product.

To keep track of customers, you will most likely either:
1) want to use purely webhooks and [Stripe](https://dashboard.stripe.com/) to manage your users
2) or use the [Auth](/docs/features/auth) feature with a [profiles table](/docs/tutorials/database#profiles-table) to manage user access.

<Info>
    If going with the first option, set `appConfig.payment.auth` to `false` so that it does not require a `customerId` on checkout.

<Callout>
    If you haven't already, set up [Stripe](/docs/tutorials/stripe) for your project.

## Steps

1. **Stripe Setup:**
    Set up [Stripe](/docs/tutorials/stripe) for your project (create a **One-time Product/s**).

2. **Configuration:**
    Update your [`config.js`](/docs/features/config) and [`pricingConfig`](/docs/features/config#payments) to reflect your one-time product. **`priceId`** is required
    the rest are mostly optional.

3. **Checkout:**
    - By default, the `LandingPage` and `/pricing` route will use the `Pricing` component display your pricing config and let users checkout.
    - If you want manual control, you can use the `/components/payments/` components to create your own checkout flow. For example:
        ```js
        import CheckoutButton from "@/components/payments/CheckoutButton";

        <CheckoutButton
            mode="payment"
            priceId="price_1N..."
        >
            Subscribe Now
        </CheckoutButton>
        ```

4. **Webhook (optional):**
    Tweak how your app handles webhooks by modifying the `/libs/stripe/webhookHandlers.js` file (i.e. send emails, update access if using [Auth](/docs/features/auth), etc.).

And you're done!

<Tip>
    Remember to test everything in Test mode before going to Live mode. You can use the test card number 4242 4242 4242 4242 for a successful payment.
