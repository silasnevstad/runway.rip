<div id="overview" />

1. Set up [Stripe](/docs/features/payments) in your app.

2. If you don't care about storing the user's status/access, set [`appConfig.requiredCustomerId`](/docs/tutorials/config#customer-tracking) to `false`
(e.g. if not using auth and purely using [Stripe](https://stripe.com/dashboard/) to manage your customers).

    <Caution>
        If you do want to store the user's status/access, make sure you have set up [Auth](/docs/tutorials/authentication) and [profiles table](/docs/features/db#profiles) (ensure you have the `handle_new_user` function to create Stripe customers on sign up).
    </Caution>

3. By default, the landing page will now show a [`Pricing`](/docs/landing/pricing) component. Place or modify this however you like:

     ```javascript
     import Pricing from "@/components/landing/Pricing";
     <Pricing />
     ```

    Or simply use the [`CheckoutButton`](/docs/components/checkout-button) component to create a checkout button for your product.

     ```javascript
     import CheckoutButton from "@/components/payments/CheckoutButton";
     <CheckoutButton
       mode="subscription"
       priceId="price_1N..."
     >
         Subscribe Now
     </CheckoutButton>
     ```

<br />

And you're done!

<Tip>
    Remember to test everything in Test mode before going to Live mode. You can use the test card number 4242 4242 4242 4242 for a successful payment.
