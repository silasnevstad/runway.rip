<div id="overview" />

First, if you haven't already, set up [Stripe](/docs/features/payments) in your app.
<br />

<div id="setup" />

Nice, now you've completed that, we're pretty much done already!
All that's left is deciding how you want to showcase your product's pricing plans and testing before going live.

<br />

You can either use the [`Pricing`](/docs/landing/pricing) component to show all pricing plans.

```javascript
import Pricing from "@/components/landing/Pricing";

<Pricing />
```

<Callout>
    Easy as that! [`Pricing`](/docs/landing/pricing) pulls everything it needs from [`pricingConfig`](/docs/tutorials/config).
</Callout>

<br />

Or, if you want a simpler flow use the [`CheckoutButton`](/docs/components/checkout-button) component to create a checkout button for your product.

```javascript
import CheckoutButton from "@/components/payments/CheckoutButton";
import { pricingConfig } from "@/config";

<CheckoutButton
  mode="payment"
  priceId={pricingConfig.plans[0].intervals[0].priceId}
>
    Buy Now
</CheckoutButton>
```

<Caution>
    Have to provide your own `mode` and `priceId` props.
</Caution>

<br />


## Testing

<div id="testing-your-payment" />

Now that you have everything set up, it's time to test your payment flow before going live.

1. Make sure you have the Test mode API keys in your `.env.local` file.

2. Open `http://localhost:3000` in your browser.
