Choose between either [Resend](https://resend.com) or [Mailgun](https://www.mailgun.com).

Don't have a domain yet? Check out the [Set up Domain](/docs/tutorials/domain-setup) guide first. ðŸ”—


<Tip>
    Both have the same free tier (100 emails/day), but Resend's Pro tier is offers more emails and unlimited domains for only $5/month more.
