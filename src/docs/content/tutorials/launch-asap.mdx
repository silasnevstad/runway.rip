<div id="overview" />

Before you begin, make sure you’ve completed the [installation](/docs/installation) guide so your project is up and running.

Runway is wired to pull in settings from [`config.js`](/docs/features/config).
That means you only need to focus on updating your config to change the app’s behavior, style, and copy.

<br />

<div id="customizing-your-copy" />

1. Open **`src/config.js`** and update the common settings to reflect your app’s details. At a minimum, update:

    - **App Information:**
    Modify `appName`, `appDescription`, and `domain` to match your app.

    ```config.js
    const appConfig = {
        // General
        appName: 'Your App Name',
        appDescription: 'Your App Description',
        domain: 'yourdomain.com',
        legal: { policies: { privacy: '/policies/privacy', terms: '/policies/terms', license: '/policies/license' } },
        socialMedia: { twitter: '', instagram: '', github: '', linkedin: '' }
    };
    ```

    <Info>
        - `socialMedia` can be left empty if you don't want social links.
        - The `legal.policies` already point to the default policies. You can update them later.
        **If you do not want policies delete the `/policies` folder.**
        - These settings are used all over the app (SEO, footer, etc.)
    </Info>

    <br />

2. Decide what you want to enable and set up [authentication](/docs/features/auth), [payments](/docs/features/payments),
   [database](/docs/features/database), [emails](/docs/features/emails),...

    <div className="my-4" />

    <Callout>
        If you’re not ready for full auth/payments, you might use waitlist mode to start collecting leads.

        ```config.js
        const appConfig = {
            waitlist: {
                enabled: false,
            },
        };
        ```

        You need to setup [Supbase](/docs/tutorials/supabase) and [waitlist table](/docs/tutorials/database#waitlist-table) to use this feature.
    </Callout>

    <br />

    <div id="setting-up-your-landing-page" />
3. Customize the landing page, `(noauth)/page.js`. Your landing page is powered by the `landingConfig` object in [`config.js`](/docs/features/config#landing-page).

    This object controls every section of your landing page without you needing to touch any component code.

    <Tip>
        Feel free to start from scratch my just deleting `LandingPage` in `/src/app/(noauth)/page.js`.
        You can use the Runway's `/components` to build your own page.
    </Tip>

    For example:

    - **Hero Section:**
    Update the headline, description, and call-to-action button.

    ```js
    export const landingConfig = {
        hero: {
            textHighlight: {
                text: "Code less, launch faster.",
                highlight: "launch faster.",
                fromGradient: "primary",
                toGradient: "purple"
            },
            textPosition: "center",
            description: "A complete Next.js boilerplate to help you focus on innovation.",
            buttonText: "Get Started",
            buttonHref: "#pricing",
            image: { ... },
            trustedBy: { show: false }
        }
    };
    ```

    <div className="my-6" />

    - **Features Section:**
    Add or remove features as needed.

    ```js
    export const featuresConfig = [
        {
            title: "Auth",
            description: "Implement user auth...",
            features: ["Magic links & Social auth",...],
            icon: FaUserShield,
        },
        ...
    ];
    ```

    <div className="my-6" />

    Adjust the copy and visibility of other sections as needed (`faq`, `pricing`, `cta`, `withWithouts`, etc.)

    <Callout>
        Play around with different layouts and content to find what works best for you.
    </Callout>

    <div className="my-6" />
    <div id="color-theme" />
4. Customize the [color theme](/docs/features/config#color-theme) to match your brand.


<br />

Run `npm run dev` and visit [`http://localhost:3000`](http://localhost:3000) to see your live app.
