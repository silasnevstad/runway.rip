<div id="overview" />

Before you begin, make sure you’ve completed the [installation](/docs/installation) guide so your project is up and running.

Runway is wired to pull in settings from [`config.js`](/docs/features/config).
That means you only need to focus on updating your config to change the app’s behavior, style, and copy.

<br />

1. Open **`src/config.js`** and update the common settings to reflect your app’s details. At a minimum, update:

    - **App Information:**
    Modify `appName`, `appDescription`, and `domain` to match your app.

    ```js
    const appConfig = {
        // General
        appName: 'Your App Name',
        appDescription: 'Your App Description',
        domain: 'yourdomain.com',
        legal: { policies: { privacy: '/policies/privacy', terms: '/policies/terms', license: '/policies/license' } },
        socialMedia: { twitter: '', instagram: '', github: '', linkedin: '' }
    };
    ```

    <Info>
        - `socialMedia` can be left empty if you don't want social links.
        - The `legal.policies` already point to the default policies. You can update them later.
        **If you do not want policies delete the `/policies` folder.**
        - These settings are used all over the app (SEO, footer, etc.)
    </Info>

    <br />

2. Decide whether you want to enable [authentication](/docs/features/auth) and [payments](/docs/features/payments):

    ```js
    const appConfig = {
        // Auth
        auth: {
            // add any of ['password', 'magiclink', 'google', 'github', 'apple']
            methods: [],
            protectedRoutes: ['/dashboard', '/account'],
            afterLoginPath: '/account',
            afterSignupPath: '/confirm-email'
        },

        // Payment
        payment: {
            // Set to false if you don't need payments now.
            enabled: true,
            requiredCustomerId: true,
            afterCheckoutPath: '/account'
        }
    };
    ```

    Add the auth methods you want to use (`['password', 'magiclink', 'google', 'github', 'apple']`).

    <Info>
        - The `afterLoginPath` and `afterSignupPath` keys are used to redirect users after they log in or sign up (no need to change them).
        - The `protectedRoutes` key is used to protect routes that require authentication.
    </Info>

    <Callout>
        If you’re not ready for full auth/payments, you might use waitlist mode to start collecting leads.

        ```js
        waitlist: {
            enabled: true,
            allowedRoutes: ['/waitlist', '/docs'],
            redirect: '/waitlist'
        },
        ```

        You need to setup [Supbase](/docs/tutorials/supabase) and [waitlist table](/docs/features/db#waitlist-table) to use this feature.
    </Callout>

    <br />

3. Customize the landing page, `(noauth)/page.js`. Your landing page is powered by the `landingConfig` object in [`config.js`](/docs/features/config#landing-page).

    This object controls every section of your landing page without you needing to touch any component code.

    <Tip>
        Feel free to start from scratch my just deleting `/src/app/(noauth)/page.js`.
        You can use the Runway's components to build your own page.
    </Tip>

    For example:

    - **Hero Section:**
    Update the headline, description, and call-to-action button.

    ```js
    export const landingConfig = {
        hero: {
            textHighlight: {
                text: "Code less, launch faster.",
                highlight: "launch faster.",
                fromGradient: "primary",
                toGradient: "purple"
            },
            textPosition: "center",
            description: "A complete Next.js boilerplate to help you focus on innovation.",
            buttonText: "Get Started",
            buttonHref: "#pricing",
            image: { ... },
            trustedBy: { show: false }
        }
    };
    ```

    <div className="my-6" />

    - **Features Section:**
    Add or remove features as needed.

    ```js
    export const featuresConfig = [
        {
            title: "Auth",
            description: "Implement user auth...",
            features: ["Magic links & Social auth",...],
            icon: FaUserShield,
        },
        ...
    ];
    ```

    <div className="my-6" />

    Adjust the copy and visibility of other sections as needed (`faq`, `pricing`, `cta`, `withWithouts`, etc.)

    <Callout>
        Play around with different layouts and content to find what works best for you.
    </Callout>

Run `npm run dev` and visit [`http://localhost:3000`](http://localhost:3000) to see your live landing page.

Once you're happy, it's time to deploy your app. Check out the [Deployment](/docs/tutorials/deployment) guide for more details.
