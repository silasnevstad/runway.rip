If you are using payments or Oauth, it's mandatory to have a privacy policy and terms of service.

You can ChatGPT or something like [Termly.io](https://app.termly.io/) to generate these.

Once you've got your policies, paste them in their respective files in the `src/app/(noauth)/policies` folder.
