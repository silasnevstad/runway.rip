<br/>

The `config.js` file is the heart of your application. It handles everything from your app's name, to which auth methods
to use, to your payment configuration, and even the content of your landing page.

### Content

- [AppConfig](#appconfig)
    - [General](#general)
    - [Auth](#auth)
    - [Emails](#emails)
    - [Waitlist Mode](#waitlist)
    - [Payment Integration](#payment-integration)
- [Payments](#payments)
- [Landing Page](#landing)
    - [Features](#features)
    - [FAQs](#faqs)
    - [Withs & Withouts](#with-withouts)


<Callout>
    Most of these are optional, so just fill in what you need.

## AppConfig

The `AppConfig` object is the core of your application. I've split it up into a couple sections:

<div className="my-15"/>

<div id="general" />
### General

<div className="my-5"/>

```config.js
const appConfig = {
    // General
    appName: 'Runway',
    appDescription: 'Everything you need to launch your ideas.',
    domain: 'runway.rip',
    legal: {
        policies: {
            privacy: '/policies/privacy',
            terms: '/policies/terms',
            license: '/policies/license'
        }
    },
    socialMedia: {
        twitter: 'https://twitter.com/runway',
        instagram: 'https://instagram.com/runway',
        github: 'https://github.com/runway-app',
        linkedin: ''
    }
};
```

<div className="my-5"/>

Here all you need to change is the `appName`, `appDescription`, and `domain`. The rest is optional (legal policies already
point to the right place).

<Info>
    This info used in various places... `appName` in header, `domain` for SEO, `appDescription` for footer, SEO, etc
</Info>

<br />
<div id="auth" />
### Auth

<div className="my-5"/>

```config.js
const appConfig = {
    // Auth
    // options: password, magiclink, google, apple, github
    authMethods: ['password', 'google', 'github'],
    protectedRoutes: [
        '/dashboard',
        '/account'
    ],
    afterLoginPath: '/account',
    // This is only need if you use password method
    afterSignupPath: '/confirm-email'
};
```

<div className="my-5"/>

Simply **add the auth methods** you want to use to the `authMethods` array (any combination works).

Then **remember to add the routes you want to protect** to the `protectedRoutes` array (the middleware will take care of the rest).

`afterLoginPath` is where the user will be redirected after logging in. The `afterSignupPath` is where the user will be
redirected after they sign up. They can both be left untouched.

<br />
<div id="emails" />

### Emails

<div className="my-5"/>

```config.js
const appConfig = {
    // Email
    supportEmail: "Runway Support <support@mail.runway.rip>",
    noReplyEmail: "Runway <noreply@mail.runway.rip>"
};
```

<div className="my-5"/>

Pretty self-explanatory. Just change the emails to your own.

<br />
<div id="waitlist" />
### Waitlist Mode

<div className="my-5"/>

```config.js
const appConfig = {
    // Waitlist / Pre-Launch Mode:
    waitlistMode: true,
    waitlistAllowedRoutes: ['/waitlist', '/docs'],
    waitlistRedirect: '/waitlist'
};
```

<div className="my-5"/>

If you want to enable the waitlist mode, set `waitlistMode` to `true`. This will redirect all routes not specified in
`waitlistAllowedRoutes` to `waitlistRedirect`.

<Tip>
    This is useful for when you are still building your app and want to collect emails before launch.

<div id="payment-integration" />
### Payment Integration

<div className="my-5"/>

```config.js
const appConfig = {
    // Payment Integration
    requiredCustomerId: true,
    afterCheckoutPath: '/account'
};
```

<div className="my-5"/>

`requiredCustomerId` will essentially ensure that you **track your customers** (automatically happens if you set up subscriptions).

**You only need to change this to `false` if your app is a one-time payment with no auth.**

<Caution>
    Setting up [Supabase Auth](/docs/features/auth) is required to track your customers.
</Caution>

`afterCheckoutPath` is where the user will be redirected after checking out. It can be left untouched.

## Payments

The `pricingConfig` object is used to configure your payments. It is used by the [`Pricing`](/docs/components/landing/pricing) component
and the [`CheckoutButton`](/docs/components/checkout-button) component.

**[Set up your Payments here.](/docs/features/payments)**


Example of a one-time payment plan:

```config.js
export const pricingConfig = {
    plans: [
        {
            // "payment" (One-time purchase) or "subscription" (Recurring)
            mode: "payment",
            intervals: [
                {
                    label: "",
                    oldPrice: 99,
                    price: 49,
                    // COPY YOUR PRICE ID IN HERE
                    priceId: "price_XXX"
                }
            ],
            // Customize presentation
            title: "Starter",
            description: "",
            subText: "Pay once, use forever.",
            isPopular: false,
            features: [
                "NextJS boilerplate",
                "Component library",
                "Database",
                "Payments",
                "Auth",
                "Email Service",
                "Lifetime updates",
            ],
        },
    ]
};
```

<div className="my-5"/>

The `plans` array is where you define your plans. You can have as many as you want. Each plan has a `mode` (either `payment` or `subscription`) and an `intervals` array (just one for one-time payments).
The `intervals` array is where you define the `price` and the `priceId` (created in [Stripe](https://stripe.com)).

The `title`, `description`, `subText`, `isPopular`, and `features` are used to customize the presentation of the plan. And
`isPopular` is used to highlight a plan.

<br />

Here's an example of a subscription plan:

```config.js
export const pricingConfig = {
        plans: [
        {  // Starter Plan
            mode: "subscription", // Recurring
            intervals: [
                {
                    name: "monthly",
                    label: "Monthly",
                    oldPrice: 29,
                    price: 19,
                    discountLabel: "Save 40%",
                    priceId: "price_monthly_xxx"
                },
                {
                    name: "yearly",
                    label: "Yearly",
                    oldPrice: 199,
                    price: 99,
                    discountLabel: "Save 50%",
                    priceId: "price_yearly_xxx"
                }
            ],
            title: "Starter",
            description: "",
            subText: "Pay monthly or yearly.",
            isPopular: false,
            features: [
                "NextJS boilerplate",
                "Component library",
                "Database",
                "Payments",
                "Auth",
                "Email Service",
                "Lifetime updates",
            ],
        },
    ]
};
```

<Tip>
    Use `isPopular`, `oldPrice`, and `discountLabel` to highlight and promote your plans.
</Tip>

<br />

Also inside the `pricingConfig` is a `promo` object, I recommend you use this to promote your product:

```config.js
export const pricingConfig = {
    promo: {
        show: true,
        price: 50,
        text: "off for first 1000 users (12 left)",
        code: "LAUNCH",
    },
};
```

<Info>
    `code` is automatically applied to the checkout session.

## Landing Page

The `landingConfig` object is used to configure your landing page. It is used by the [`Hero`](/docs/components/landing/hero),
[`Features`](/docs/components/landing/features), [`Pricing`](/docs/components/landing/pricing), [`Faqs`](/docs/components/landing/faqs),
[`WithWithouts`](/docs/components/landing/with-withouts), and [`Testimonials`](/docs/components/landing/testimonials) components.
