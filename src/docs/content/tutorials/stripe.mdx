<div id="environment-setup" />

1. Create a [Stripe account](https://stripe.com/login) and retrieve your API keys from [API Keys](https://dashboard.stripe.com/apikeys).

2. Copy them into `.env.local`:


    ```.env.local
    NEXT_PUBLIC_STRIPE_PUBLISHABLE_KEY=pk_live_...
    NEXT_PUBLIC_STRIPE_SECRET_KEY=sk_live_...
    ```

<div id="stripe-configuration" />

## Stripe Configuration

1. Under [Business details](https://dashboard.stripe.com/settings/business-details), enter your website URL, support email, and legal policy URLs.

    <Tip>
        You can use your own email or setup your domain email following the [Email](/docs/features/emails) tutorial.
    </Tip>

2. Go to [Branding](https://dashboard.stripe.com/settings/branding) and customize your branding (logo & colors, etc.).

3. In [Customer emails](https://dashboard.stripe.com/settings/emails) and turn on emails for 'successful payments' and 'refunds'.

4. Go to [Customer Portal](https://dashboard.stripe.com/settings/billing/portal) and turn on 'Customer portal link'.

    <Callout>
        For professional checkout, consider setting up a [custom domain](https://dashboard.stripe.com/settings/custom-domains).

## Create Products

You have to repeat the following steps for both Test and Live mode.

First, create products and a webhook in Test mode, test them, and then repeat the steps in Live mode.

1. Turn ON Test Mode.

2. Go to [Product catalog](https://dashboard.stripe.com/test/products) and click on [+ Create product](https://dashboard.stripe.com/test/products?active=true&create=product&source=product_list).

2. Fill in the product details and select either **Recurring** (for subscriptions/usage-based) or **One-off** (for one-time payments).

4. Copy the price ID (`price_1N...`) into [`pricingConfig`](/docs/features/config#payments). And update the `mode` to either `payment` or `subscription` depending on the product you created.

    ```js
    export const pricingConfig = {
        plans: [
            {
                mode: "payment",
                title: "Starter",
                intervals: [{ priceId: "price_XXX", price: 99 }],
                // ...
            },
            {
                mode: "subscription",
                title: "Pro",
                intervals: [
                    {
                        name: "monthly",
                        priceId: "price_monthly_XXX",
                        price: 19
                    },
                    {
                        name: "yearly",
                        priceId: "price_yearly_XXX",
                        price: 190
                    }
                ]
                // ...
            },
            {
                mode: "subscription",
                title: "Usage",
                intervals: [
                    {
                        name: "monthly",
                        priceId: "price_monthly_XXX",
                        price: 0.05
                    }
                ]
            }
        ]
    };
    ```

    <Tip>
        In [`config.js`](/docs/features/config#payments), I have provided a sample configuration for both one-time and recurring payments, select the one that fits your product.
        You can simply have one plan if you want.
    </Tip>

    <Callout>
        The [`Pricing`](/docs/landing/pricing) component will automatically pull everything it needs from the [`pricingConfig`](/docs/features/config#payments) object.
    </Callout>

<div id="webhook-setup" />

## Webhook Setup

Now we need to set up webhooks to listen for events from Stripe. This is skippable if you are not using subscriptions or don't want to listen for events from Stripe.

1. Go to [Webhooks](https://dashboard.stripe.com/test/workbench/webhooks) and click on [+ Add endpoint](https://dashboard.stripe.com/test/workbench/webhooks/create).

2. Select events such as:
    - `checkout.session.completed`
    - `checkout.session.expired`
    - `customer.subscription.created`
    - `customer.subscription.updated`
    - `customer.subscription.deleted`
    - `customer.subscription.trial_will_end`
    - `invoice.paid`
    - `invoice.payment_failed`

3. Select 'Webhook endpoint' as destination type.

4. Paste this URL as the endpoint URL (replace `YOURDOMAIN.COM` with your domain):

    ```plaintext
    http://YOURDOMAIN.COM/api/stripe/webhooks
    ```

5. Create the endpoint and copy the signing secret (`whsec_...`) into `.env.local`:

    ```.env.local
    NEXT_PUBLIC_STRIPE_WEBHOOK_SECRET=whsec_...
    ```

<Callout>
    This webhook will listen for events from Stripe and handle it accordingly, i.e. update the user's access in the database.
</Callout>
