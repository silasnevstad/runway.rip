To make your app stand out, here are some extra components and tricks I like to use.

<br />

<div id="scrollbar" />

## ScrollBar

I've already customized the scrollbar for Runway, but if you want to further customize it, open `src/app/globals.css` and add your own styles.

```globals.css
/* Scrollbar */
::-webkit-scrollbar {
    width: 8px;
    height: 8px;
}
```
