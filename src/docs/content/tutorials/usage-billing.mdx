<Callout>
    Usage billing require that you have [Auth](/docs/features/auth) enabled.
</Callout>

Usage billing (metered billing) lets you charge customers based on the actual usage of your service. In Runway, usage billing is implemented as a special type of subscription.

Users first subscribe to a product, and then you report usage events to Stripe. Stripe will then calculate the amount to charge based on the reported usage.

<br />

## Steps

1. Set up [Stripe](/docs/tutorials/stripe) for your project.

    <div className="my-5"/>

2. In your [Stripe Dashboard](https://dashboard.stripe.com/test/meters), create a meter that tracks usage events.

    <div className="my-5"/>

3. Create a recurring [Product](https://dashboard.stripe.com/products) with a metered price.
    - Select **Recurring** for the product type
    - Under **Billing period** select **More pricing options**.
    - Under **Choose your pricing model**, selected **Usage-based** and **Per package**
    - Set the **Price per unit** to the amount you want to charge per unit.
    - Under **Meter** select the meter you created in step 1.

    <div className="my-5"/>

4. **Configuration:**
    Update your [`config.js`](/docs/features/config) and [`pricingConfig`](/docs/features/config#payments) to reflect your product.

    <div className="my-5"/>

5. **Checkout:**
    - By default, the `LandingPage` and `/pricing` route will use the `Pricing` component display your pricing config and let users checkout.
    - If you want manual control, you can use the `/components/payments/` components to create your own checkout flow. For example:
    ```js
    import CheckoutButton from "@/components/payments/CheckoutButton";

    <CheckoutButton
        mode="payment"
        priceId="price_1N..."
    >
        Subscribe Now
    </CheckoutButton>
    ```

    <div className="my-5"/>

6. **Usage Reporting:**
    Use the `addUsage` helper to report usage events.

    ```
    import { addUsage } from "@/libs/stripe/usage";
    await addUsage({ customerId: "cus_XXX", eventName: "alpaca_ai_tokens", quantity: 10 });
    ```

    <div className="my-5"/>

7. Our webhook `api/webhooks/stripe` listens to the [Stripe](https://stripe.com) events we've selected and automatically handles updating the user's access in the database.

    <Info>
        We've created a `customerId` for each user and use `has_access`, `price_id`, etc. in the [**profiles table**](/docs/tutorials/database#profiles-table) to track the user's subscription status.
    </Info>

    <div className="my-5"/>

8. (Optional) Add your own logic to `webhookHandlers.js` or `subscriptionHandlers.js`, like sending abandoned checkout emails, etc.

    <div className="my-5"/>

9. Use the `libs/stripe/portal.js` or [`AccountCard`](/docs/components/auth/account-card) component to let users manage their subscription.

    ```js
    import AccountCard from "@/components/auth/AccountCard";

    <AccountCard user={user} />
    ```

<br />

<Tip>
    Remember to test everything in Test mode before going to Live mode. You can use the test card number 4242 4242 4242 4242 for a successful payment.

    Refer to [Stripe's usage billing docs](https://stripe.com/docs/billing/subscriptions/usage-based) for more details.
