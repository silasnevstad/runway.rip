1. Open your terminal and run the following commands to clone the repo and install dependencies:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/silasnevstad/runway-js.git [YOUR-PROJECT-NAME]
   cd [YOUR-PROJECT-NAME]
   npm install
   git remote remove origin
    ```

    <Caution>
        Ensure youâ€™re running [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/) version 22 or higher (`node -v` to check).
    </Caution>
    <div className="my-10"/>

2. Rename `.env.example` to `.env.local`
    ```bash
    mv .env.example .env.local
    ```

    <Tip>
        For now you can leave the `.env.local` file as is. We'll configure it in the next steps.
    </Tip>
    <div className="my-10"/>

3. Start the development server:
    ```bash
    npm run dev
    ```

4. Open [`http://localhost:3000`](http://localhost:3000) in your browser.
