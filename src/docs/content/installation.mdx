[//]: # (### Getting Started)

1. Open your terminal and run the following commands:

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/silasnevstad/runway-js.git [YOUR-PROJECT-NAME]
    cd [YOUR-PROJECT-NAME]
    npm install
    git remote remove origin
    ```

    <Caution>
        Runway requires [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/) version 18 or higher.
        Type `node -v` to check your version.
    </Caution>
    <div className="my-10"/>

2. Rename `.env.example` to `.env.local`
    ```bash
    mv .env.example .env.local
    ```

    <Tip>
        For now you can leave the `.env.local` file as is. We'll configure it in the next steps.
    </Tip>
    <div className="my-10"/>

3. Open [`http://localhost:3000`](http://localhost:3000) in your browser.
