Runway follows a typical [Next.js](http://nextjs.org) App router project structure with some custom organization.

If you're unfamiliar with Next.js, I recommend checking out their
[project structure documentation](https://nextjs.org/docs/getting-started/project-structure).

Let's briefly go over the key parts of our project structure.

### Top-level Structure

At the root of the project, you'll find these key elements:

| Folder/File                     | Description                                               |
|---------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------|
| [`src/`](#src-folder-structure) | Contains all the application source code                  |
| `public/`                       | Stores static assets to be served directly                |
| `.env.local`                    | Holds local environment variables                         |
| `tailwind.config.js`            | Configuration for [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com) |
| `.gitignore`                    | Specifies files and directories to ignore in Git          |
| `package.json`                  | Lists project dependencies and scripts                    |
| `README.md`                     | Provides project documentation                            |

The `src` folder contains all of our application code, while `public` is for static assets. The `.env.local` file stores all
our local environment variables (API keys, etc.).

<Caution>
    Never commit your `.env.local` file to version control. It contains sensitive information like API keys and should be kept private.
</Caution>

<br />

<div id="src-folder-structure" />
### `src` Folder Structure

Inside the `src` folder, we organize our code into several directories:

| Path                                  | Description                                                     |
|---------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------|
| [`app`](#app-directory-structure)     | Contains the Next.js App Router structure                       |
| [`components`](#components-directory) | Houses React components organized by atomic design              |
| `contexts`                            | Stores React context providers for global state management      |
| `libs`                                | Contains shared libraries and utilities (e.g., Stripe, Mailgun) |
| `utils`                               | Holds utility functions used across the application             |

This structure allows for a modular approach to development, separating concerns and making it easier to find and
maintain different parts of the application.

<Info>
    The `src` folder is optional in Next.js, however, I prefer the added organization it provides.
</Info>

<div id="app-directory-structure" />
### `app` Directory Structure

The `app` directory is the heart of our Next.js application, structured as follows:

| Path                            | Description                                                            |
|---------------------------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| [`(auth)`](#auth-directory)     | Contains routes that require user authentication                       |
| [`(noauth)`](#noauth-directory) | Houses public routes accessible without authentication                 |
| `actions`                       | Stores server actions for handling form submissions and data mutations |
| `api`                           | Contains API routes for backend functionality                          |
| `auth`                          | Holds authentication-related files and logic                           |
| `lib`                           | Stores library files specific to the app directory                     |

This structure leverages [Next.js app router](https://nextjs.org/docs/app), allowing for easy organization of authenticated and public routes.

<Tip>
    Use route groups (folders starting with parentheses) to organize your routes without affecting the URL structure.
</Tip>

<br />

<div id="noauth-directory" />
#### `(noauth)` Directory

The `(noauth)` directory contains our public-facing pages:

| Path            | Description                                             |
|-----------------|---------------------------------------------------------|
| `login`         | The user login page                                     |
| `signup`        | The user registration page                              |
| `confirm-email` | The email confirmation page for new users               |
| `policies`      | Legal pages such as privacy policy and terms of service |
| `waitlist`      | A page for users to join a waitlist if applicable       |
| `layout.js`     | The layout applied to all public pages                  |
| `page.js`       | The landing page of the application (`/`)               |


<br />

<div id="auth-directory" />
#### `(auth)` Directory

The `(auth)` directory contains our authenticated pages, add as many as needed.

<Info>
    Our middleware automatically redirects users to the login page if they try to access an authenticated route without being logged in.
</Info>

<br />
<br />

<div id="components-directory" />
### `components` Directory

We use the atomic design methodology to organize our React components:

| Path        | Description                                                     |
|-------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------|
| `atoms`     | Basic building blocks like buttons, inputs, and labels          |
| `molecules` | Slightly more complex components composed of atoms              |
| `organisms` | Large, complex components often composed of molecules and atoms |
| `landing`   | Components specific to the landing page                         |
| `auth`      | Components related to authentication                            |
| `payments`  | Components related to payments and subscriptions                |

This structure promotes reusability and maintainability of our UI components.

<Tip>
    When creating new components, consider their reusability. If a component is used in multiple places, it might belong in the `atoms` or `molecules` directory.
</Tip>

<div id="configuration-files" />
### Configuration Files

Key configuration files in our project:

| Path                | Description                                              |
|---------------------|----------------------------------------------------------|
| `src/config.js`     | Central configuration file for application-wide settings |
| `src/middleware.js` | Next.js middleware for route protection and redirects    |

These files are crucial for managing application behavior and security.

<div id="app-routing-conventions" />
### `app` Routing Conventions

We follow Next.js routing conventions in our `app` directory:

| File                         | Description                               |
|------------------------------|-------------------------------------------|
| `layout.js` `.jsx` `.tsx`    | Defines the layout for a route segment    |
| `page.js` `.jsx` `.tsx`      | Represents a UI that is unique to a route |
| `loading.js` `.jsx` `.tsx`   | Creates loading UI for a segment          |
| `not-found.js` `.jsx` `.tsx` | Creates not found UI for a segment        |
| `error.js` `.jsx` `.tsx`     | Defines error UI for a segment            |
| `route.js` `.ts`             | Creates API endpoints                     |

These conventions allow for intuitive and powerful routing capabilities within our Next.js application.

<Tip>
    Use `loading.js` to create seamless loading experiences for your users. It's automatically used by Next.js for route segments.
</Tip>

<Caution>
    Be cautious when using `route.js` in the same directory as `page.js`. They can conflict and lead to unexpected behavior.
</Caution>
