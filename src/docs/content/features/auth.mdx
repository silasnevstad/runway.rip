<div id="overview" />

Runway uses [Supabase](/docs/tutorials/supabase) for authentication. It supports password-based, magic link, and social logins out of the box.

Simply plug the auth methods you want into [`appConfig`](/docs/features/config) and the `/signup` and `/login` pages will
automatically adjust to your choices.

```config.js
const appConfig = {
    // Auth
    auth: {
        methods: ['magiclink', 'google'],
    }
};
```

<Tip>
    You can add as many auth methods as you want. The only requirement is that you need to have at least one method.

## Architecture

Runway employs two distinct auth clients:

- **Server Client**: Manages secure operations and supports server-side rendering.
- **Browser Client**: Utilizes a singleton pattern to handle client-side authentication.

<Callout>
    The middleware in `middleware.js` and `utils/supabase/middleware.js` is the engine behind the scenes—automatically
    storing and refreshing auth tokens for a seamless experience.
</Callout>

Unauthenticated users are automatically redirected when trying to access protected routes, as defined in your appConfig.

## Auth Methods

Runway supports multiple authentication strategies, easily enabled through `config.js`:

- [**Password Authentication:**](/docs/tutorials/auth)
    Users can sign up using a password. If enabled, a confirmation step is required—ensure you update your Supabase email
    template with a confirmation link handled by `/auth/confirm/route.ts`.

- [**Magic Link:**](/docs/tutorials/auth)
    Users receive a login link via email. As with password auth, the confirmation is processed by `/auth/confirm/route.ts` after updating your email template.

- [**OAuth:**](/docs/tutorials/auth#oauth)
    Social logins can be activated by integrating third-party providers in Supabase. Each provider requires its own manual setup.

<Caution>
    Requires minimal configuration in [Supabase](https://supabase.com/), i.e. third party providers, email templates, etc.
</Caution>

Both the `/login` and `/signup` pages use the [`AuthForm`](/docs/components/auth/auth-form) component to render the selected methods. These pages employ
[Server Actions](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/building-your-application/data-fetching/server-actions-and-mutations) to handle the signup logic securely on the server.

<div id="protected-pages" />

## Protected Pages

Runway supports protected pages (only for authenticated users) and public pages (accessible to everyone).
Access control is streamlined via our `middleware.js`.

Unauthenticated users trying to access protected pages are automatically
redirected based on the settings in `appConfig.auth.protectedPages` and `appConfig.auth.unauthenticatedRedirect`.

<Tip>
    Server Components can read cookies, making it effortless to retrieve the current auth status and user data in a secure manner.

## Payment Integration (Optional)

For apps that include payments, Runway can create a Stripe customer ID during user signup. This ID is stored in the
`auth.users` table or the [`public.profiles`](/docs/tutorials/database#stripe-integration) table (or both), which simplifies
tracking payment methods and subscription details.
