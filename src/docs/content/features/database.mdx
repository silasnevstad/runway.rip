<Tip>
    Follow the [Database tutorial](/docs/tutorials/database) to set up your database and tables.
</Tip>

Runway uses [Supabase](https://supabase.com/) to power its database layer. Whether you need to manage profiles,
build waitlists, collect feedback, host posts, etc., our database setup is designed to be flexible and secure.

## Profiles Table

The **profiles** table is at the heart of user data management. It stores essential fields such as:

- **User Identification:** Linked to the `auth.users` table.
- **Contact Information:** Including email, name, and profile image.
- **Payment Integration:** Optional fields like `has_access`, `customer_id`, `subscription_id`, and `subscription_status` streamline payment management if you're using Stripe.

<Callout>
    If you’re integrating payments, the `customer_id` field connects each user to their Stripe record, simplifying subscription and billing processes.
</Callout>

## Optional Tables

Beyond profiles, you can extend your database with additional tables to suit your application’s needs:

- [**Waitlist Table:**](/docs/tutorials/database#waitlist-table) Collect emails for pre-launch waitlists or newsletters.
- **Feedback Table:** Capture user feedback and reviews.
- **Posts Table:** Manage user-generated content or blog posts.

## Stripe Integration

For apps with payment functionality, Runway can automatically create a Stripe customer ID during user signup. This ID is stored in the **profiles** table or directly in `auth.users`, which helps in:

- Managing payment methods and subscriptions.
- Tracking usage for billing purposes.

<Caution>
    Make sure you have followed [this tutorial](/docs/tutorials/database#customer-id) so that the customer ID is created and stored correctly.
</Caution>
