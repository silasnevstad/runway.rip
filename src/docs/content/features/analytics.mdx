<div id="overview" />

Tracking and analyzing your website's data is crucial for understanding and growing your audience.

There are a couple options for tracking analytics in your app:

- [**Google Analytics**](https://analytics.google.com/): The most popular analytics tool, offering a wide range of features and integrations.
- [**Fathom Analytics**](https://usefathom.com/): A privacy-focused analytics tool that is easy to use and set up (30 day free trial) (GDPR compliant).
- [**Umami**](https://umami.is/): An open-source, self-hosted analytics tool that is easy to use and set up.
- [**Google Search Console**](https://search.google.com/search-console): A free tool from Google that helps you monitor and maintain your site's presence in Google search results.

<Info>
    I'd always recommend using [Google Search Console](https://search.google.com/search-console) in addition to any of the above.

## Usage

For most of these, it's as easy as setting up an account and pasting the tracking script into the root `/layout.js` file.

For [Fathom](https://usefathom.com/) use [this guide](https://vercel.com/guides/deploying-nextjs-using-fathom-analytics-with-vercel).

<Callout>
    I would recommend trying out [**Fathom's**](https://usefathom.com/) 30 day free trial first. Then fallback to
    [**Google Analytics**](https://analytics.google.com/) or [**Umami**](https://umami.is/) if you don't like it.
