<div id="overview" />

Tracking and analyzing your website's data is crucial for understanding and growing your audience.

There are a couple options for tracking analytics in your app:

- [**Google Analytics**](https://analytics.google.com/): The most popular analytics tool, offering a wide range of features and integrations.
- [**Fathom Analytics**](https://usefathom.com/): A privacy-focused analytics tool that is easy to use and set up (30 day free trial) (GDPR compliant).
- [**Umami**](https://umami.is/): An open-source, self-hosted analytics tool that is easy to use and set up.
- [**Google Search Console**](https://search.google.com/search-console): A free tool from Google that helps you monitor and maintain your site's presence in Google search results.

<Info>
    I'd always recommend using [Google Search Console](https://search.google.com/search-console) in addition to any of the above.

## Usage

For most of these, it's as easy as setting up an account and pasting the tracking script into the root `/layout.js` file.

For [Fathom](https://usefathom.com/) use get your `FATHOM_ID` and paste it into the `.env.local`:

```.env.local
NEXT_PUBLIC_FATHOM_ID=your-fathom-id
```

Then, in your `/layout.js` file, add the following code:

```layout.js
import { getSEOTags } from "@/libs/seo";
import { FathomAnalytics } from "@/libs/fathom/fathom";

const inter = Inter({ subsets: ["latin"] });

export const metadata = getSEOTags({
    title: appConfig.appName,
    description: appConfig.appDescription,
    canonicalUrlRelative: "/",
});

export default function RootLayout({ children }) {
    return (
        <html lang="en" suppressHydrationWarning>
            <body className={inter.className}>
                <FathomAnalytics />
                <AppProviders>
                    {children}
                </AppProviders>
            </body>
        </html>
    );
}
```
