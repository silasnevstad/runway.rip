In Runway, when an errors occurs [Next.js](https://nextjs.org) will handle it gracefully through the following files:

- `/app/error.js` handles [JavaScript](https://www.javascript.com) errors.
- `/app/not-found.js` handles 404 errors (not found).

<Info>
    These pages are set up by default, but you can customize them to fit your needs.

Using `libs/api.js` for [API calls](/docs/tutorials/api-routes), errors are handled gracefully (401 errors are redirected to `/login`, while other errors are shown as toast notifications).
