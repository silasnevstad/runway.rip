<div id="choose-email-provider" />

Choose between [Resend](https://resend.com) or [Mailgun](https://www.mailgun.com), or use both.

**Resend** is a modern email service that offers a simple API, great performance but <span className="underline">cannot receive emails</span>.

**Mailgun** is a more traditional email service that offers a powerful API, great performance and has a <span className="underline">workaround to reroute emails</span>.

<div className="flex items-center">
    <TutorialGuide options={[
        { name: 'Resend', value: 'resend', image: '/logos/resend.png', imageClassName: 'bg-black rounded-lg' },
        { name: 'Mailgun', value: 'mailgun', image: '/logos/mailgun.png' },
    ]}>
        <div id="resend">
            <div id="set-up" />

            ## Setup
            1. Sign up for a [Resend](https://resend.com) account.

                <div className="my-5" />

            2. Go to the [Domains](https://resend.com/domains) in the sidebar and click **Add Domain**. Add your domain (i.e. mail.yourdomain.com).

                <Tip>
                    It's recommend to use a subdomain for your email service, such as mail.yourdomain.com.
                </Tip>

                <div className="my-5" />

            3. Verify your domain by adding the DNS records provided by Resend to your domain's DNS settings.

                <Info>
                    Will take ~15 minutes to verify.
                </Info>

                <div className="my-5" />

            4. Go to [API Keys](https://resend.com/api-keys) in the sidebar and click **Create API Key**. Add this to the `.env.local` file as `NEXT_PUBLIC_RESEND_API_KEY`.

                ```.env.local
                NEXT_PUBLIC_RESEND_API_KEY=re_...
                ```

                <div className="my-5" />

            5. (Optional) If you want your auth emails to be sent from your domain, go to [SMTP Settings](https://resend.com/settings/smtp) and copy the SMTP settings.

                Add this to the [SMTP settings](https://supabase.com/dashboard/project/cpnazmlhikivzgcemgzp/auth/smtp) in [Supabase](https://supabase.co) along with the other details.

                ```txt
                Host: smtp.resend.com
                Port: 465
                Username: resend
                Password: YOUR_API_KEY
                ```

            <br />

            <div id="sending-emails" />

            ## Sending Emails
            You can now send emails using `sendEmail` from `@libs/resend`.

            ```js
            import { sendEmail } from "@libs/resend";

            await sendEmail({
                to,
                from,
                subject,
                message,
                tags,
                replyTo
            });
            ```

            <br />
            <br />

            <div id="receiving-emails" />

            ## Receiving Emails

            Unfortunately, Resend does not support receiving emails.

            <Tip>
                Add your own email to `replyTo` to receive replies.
            </Tip>

        </div>

        <div id="mailgun">
            <div id="set-up" />

            ## Setup
            1. Sign up for a [Mailgun](https://signup.mailgun.com/new/signup) account.

                <div className="my-5" />

            2. Go to [Domains](https://app.mailgun.com/mg/sending/domains) and click [**Add New Domain**](https://app.mailgun.com/mg/sending/new-domain).

                <Tip>
                    It's recommend to use a subdomain for your email service, such as mail.yourdomain.com.
                </Tip>

                <Caution>
                    If you are using EU infrastructure, go to `libs/mailgun/mailgun.js` and uncomment the line.
                </Caution>

                <div className="my-5" />

            3. Complete the DNS verification process by adding the DNS records provided by Mailgun to your domain's DNS settings.

                <Info>
                    This could take up to 48 hours but usually happens within a few minutes.
                </Info>

                <div className="my-5" />

            4. Navigate to [API Security](https://app.mailgun.com/settings/api_security) and click **Add new Key**, then add this to the `.env.local` as `NEXT_PUBLIC_MAILGUN_API_KEY`.

                ```.env.local
                NEXT_PUBLIC_MAILGUN_API_KEY=4dc...
                ```

                <div className="my-5" />

            5. Add the domain you verified to the `.env.local` as `NEXT_PUBLIC_MAILGUN_DOMAIN`.

                ```.env.local
                NEXT_PUBLIC_MAILGUN_DOMAIN=mail.yourdomain.com
                ```

                <div className="my-5" />


            6. (Optional) If you want your auth emails to be sent from your domain, go to [Domain Settings](https://app.mailgun.com/mg/sending/_/settings?tab=smtp), then click **Reset Password** and choose **Automatic**.

                Copy the password from the modal in the bottom right corner and add it to the [SMTP settings](https://supabase.com/dashboard/project/cpnazmlhikivzgcemgzp/auth/smtp) in [Supabase](https://supabase.co) along with the other details.

                ```txt
                Host: smtp.mailgun.org
                Port: 587
                Username: postmaster@mail.yourdomain.com
                Password: THE ONE YOU COPIED
                ```

            <br />

            <div id="sending-emails" />
            ## Sending Emails

            You can now send emails using `sendEmail` from `@libs/mailgun`.

            ```js
            import { sendEmail } from "@libs/mailgun";

            await sendEmail({
                to,
                from,
                subject,
                text,
                html,
                tags,
                attachments
            });
            ```

            <br />
            <br />

            <div id="receiving-emails" />
            ## Receiving Emails

            1. Go to [Routes](https://app.mailgun.com/mg/receiving/routes) and click **Create Route**.

            2. Select your `Expression type`:
                - **Match Recipient**: If you want to receive emails sent to a specific address (i.e. silas@mail.runway.rip).
