Choose between either [Resend](https://resend.com) or [Mailgun](https://www.mailgun.com).

**Resend** is a modern email service that offers a simple API, great performance but <span className="underline">cannot receive emails</span>.

**Mailgun** is a more traditional email service that offers a powerful API, great performance and has a <span className="underline">workaround to reroute emails</span>.

    <TutorialGuide options={[
        { name: 'Resend', value: 'resend', image: '/logos/resend.png', imageClassName: 'bg-black rounded-lg' },

    ]}>
        <div id="resend">
            <div id="set-up" />

            ## Setup
            1. Sign up for a [Resend](https://resend.com) account.

            2. Go to the [Domains](https://resend.com/domains) in the sidebar and click **Add Domain**. Add your domain (i.e. mail.yourdomain.com).

                <Tip>
                    It's recommend to use a subdomain for your email service, such as mail.yourdomain.com.
                </Tip>

            3. Verify your domain by adding the DNS records provided by Resend to your domain's DNS settings.

            4. Go to [API Keys](https://resend.com/api-keys) in the sidebar and click **Create API Key**. Add this to the `.env.local` file as `NEXT_PUBLIC_RESEND_API_KEY`.

                ```.env.local
                NEXT_PUBLIC_RESEND_API_KEY=re_...
                ```

            <br />

            <div id="sending-emails" />

            ## Sending Emails
            You can now send emails using `sendEmail` from `@libs/resend`.

            ```javascript
            import { sendEmail } from "@libs/resend";

            await sendEmail({
                to,
                from,
                subject,
                message,
                tags,
                replyTo
            });
            ```

            <Tip>
                Since [Resend](https://resend.com) does not support receiving emails, you can add your own email to `replyTo` to receive replies.
            </Tip>

            <br />
            <br />

            <div id="receiving-emails" />

            ## Receiving Emails

            Unfortunately, Resend does not support receiving emails.

        </div>

        <div id="mailgun">
            <div id="set-up" />

            ## Setup
            1. Sign up for a [Mailgun](https://signup.mailgun.com/new/signup) account.

            2. Go to [Domains](https://app.mailgun.com/mg/sending/domains) and click [**Add New Domain**](https://app.mailgun.com/mg/sending/new-domain).

                <Tip>
                    It's recommend to use a subdomain for your email service, such as mail.yourdomain.com.
                </Tip>

            3. Complete the DNS verification process by adding the DNS records provided by Mailgun to your domain's DNS settings.

                <Info>
                    This could take up to 48 hours but usually happens within a few minutes.
                </Info>

            4. Navigate to [API Security](https://app.mailgun.com/settings/api_security) and click **Add new Key**, then add this to the `.env.local` as `NEXT_PUBLIC_MAILGUN_API_KEY`.

                ```.env.local
                NEXT_PUBLIC_MAILGUN_API_KEY=4dc...
                ```

            5. Add the domain you verified to the `.env.local` as `NEXT_PUBLIC_MAILGUN_DOMAIN`.

                ```.env.local
                NEXT_PUBLIC_MAILGUN_DOMAIN=mail.yourdomain.com
                ```

            And you're done!

            <div id="sending-emails" />
            ## Sending Emails

            You can now send emails using `sendEmail` from `@libs/mailgun`.

            ```javascript
            import { sendEmail } from "@libs/mailgun";

            await sendEmail({
                to,
                from,
                subject,
                text,
                html,
                tags,
                attachments
            });
            ```

            <Callout>
                You can also connect [Resend's](https://resend.com) SMTP service to your [Supabase](https://supabase.com),
                so that magic links and other emails are sent from your domain.

            ## Receiving Emails

            1. Go to [Routes](https://app.mailgun.com/mg/receiving/routes) and click **Create Route**.

            2. Select your `Expression type`:
                - **Match Recipient**: If you want to receive emails sent to a specific address (i.e. silas@mail.runway.rip).
                - **Custom**: If you want to receive emails sent to any address (i.e. <code>(match_recipient("support@yourdomain.com"), match_recipient("admin@yourdomain.com"))</code>).
                - **Catch-All**: If you want to receive emails sent to any address.

            3. Turn on **Forward** and add the email address you want to receive emails at.
