<div id="overview" />

Runway uses [Stripe](https://stripe.com) to provide a flexible payment system that supports [one-time payments](/docs/tutorials/one-time-payments),
[subscriptions](/docs/tutorials/subscriptions), and [usage-based billing](/docs/tutorials/usage-billing).

Configure your payment options via your [`appConfig`](/docs/features/config) and [`pricingConfig`](/docs/features/config#payments) to
seamlessly integrate Stripe into your application.

```config.js
const appConfig = {
    // Payments
    payments: {
        enabled: true,
        // Additional payment configuration options can be added here.
    }
};

export const pricingConfig = {
    plans: [
        ...
    ]
};
```

<Tip>
    For a detailed breakdown of the configuration options, refer to the [config documentation](/docs/features/config).

## Payment Architecture

When a payment is initiated:
- Your application creates a checkout session via the `/api/create-checkout` route.
- Stripe processes the payment or subscription.
- Webhooks from Stripe (e.g. `checkout.session.completed`, `customer.subscription.updated`, etc.) trigger automatic updates to your database and can send notification emails.

If you are using [subscriptions](/docs/tutorials/subscriptions), [usage-based billing](/docs/tutorials/usage-billing) or just want to keep track of your customers,
Runway will automatically create a Stripe customer when a user signs up. This customer ID is then stored and used to create checkout sessions and manage subscriptions.

<Callout>
    See [this tutorial](/docs/tutorials/database#stripe-integration) for more information on how to set up the database.

## Payment Methods

Runway supports three distinct methods:

- [**One-time Payments**](/docs/tutorials/one-time-payments):
Charge users a single fee. This method can work with or without user authentication.

- [**Subscriptions**](/docs/tutorials/subscriptions):
Recurring charges that require a Stripe customer to be created at sign-up.

- [**Usage-based Billing**](/docs/tutorials/usage-billing):
Charge users based on usage (metered subscriptions). This is implemented as a special kind of subscription where usage events are reported.

<Caution>
    For subscriptions and usage-based billing, ensure you have follow [this tutorial](/docs/tutorials/database#stripe-integration)
    to create and store a [Stripe](https://stripe.com) customer on sign ups.
</Caution>
<Info>
    You can use the [`config.payment.webhookHandling`](/docs/features/config#payments) to manage trial end notifications,
    invoice payments, and failures, etc.

## Usage

Runway includes pre-built components such as [`PricingPlans`](/docs/components/payments/pricing-plans) and [`CheckoutButton`](/docs/components/payments/checkout-button) that automatically display your pricing configuration.

<Tip>
    The `LandingPage` and `/pricing` page already leverage the [`Pricing`](/docs/landing/pricing) component to show all available plans.
