The `PricingPlans` component is a component that can be used to display your pricing plans. It uses the [`pricingConfig`](/docs/features/config#payments).
If you have [subscriptions](/docs/tutorials/subscriptions) with intervals, it will show a [`Switcher`](/docs/components/switcher) to switch between the intervals.

<Info>
    It uses the [`PricingCard`](/docs/components/payments/pricing-card) component to display the pricing plans.
