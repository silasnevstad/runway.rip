<div id="overview" />

The `Pricing` component is a way to showcase your product's pricing plans and allow users to compare and choose the best plan for their needs.

<Caution>
    This relies on [`pricingConfig`](/docs/features/config) for its data so you have to configure [payments](/docs/features/payments) first.
</Caution>

<Tip>
    Want a much more simple, minimalistic flow? You can simply use [`CheckoutButton`](/docs/components/checkout-button) to create a checkout button for your product.
