<div id="overview" />

<div className="flex flex-col w-full items-center justify-center gap-8">
    <Pricing cardBackground={"bg-bg-100 dark:bg-bg-800"}/>
</div>

<br />

The `Pricing` component is a way to showcase your product's pricing plans and allow users to compare and choose the best plan for their needs.

<Caution>
    This relies on [`pricingConfig`](/docs/tutorials/config) for its data so you have to configure [payments](/docs/tutorials/payments) first.
</Caution>

<Tip>
    Want a much more simple, minimalistic flow? You can simply use [`CheckoutButton`](/docs/components/checkout-button) to create a checkout button for your product.
